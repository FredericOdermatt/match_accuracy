# Match Accuracy

This is a rewritten form of the original [WMT21 Evaluation Script](https://github.com/mahfuzibnalam/terminology_evaluation/blob/040906f012d25539e0ec8d9c9ab0b61cdfc0a83e/evaluate_term_wmt.py#L87) which had a few non-ideal behaviors.

It builds the basics of the reported scores in [CacadeBeamSearch](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.14538)
